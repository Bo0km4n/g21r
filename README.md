## How to use

```
$ g21r 'Industry is increasingly turning to reconfigurable architectures
like FPGAs and CGRAs for improved performance and
energy efficiency. Unfortunately, adoption of these architectures
has been limited by their programming models. HDLs
lack abstractions for productivity and are difficult to target
from higher level languages. HLS tools are more productive,
but offer an ad-hoc mix of software and hardware abstractions
which make performance optimizations difficult.'

g21r deletes unnecessary line breaks.
Then, it adds a new line after the period and writes the formatted document to the clipboard.
You can paste formatted documents directly into Google Translate with `Command + V`.
